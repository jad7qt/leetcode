# LeetCode
My compilation of all my LeetCode problem answers with corresponding explainations. Working towards finishing the [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/).

### Directory Structure
The repository is organized based on the sections of LeetCode's Top Interview 150, such as Array/String, Two Pointer, Sliding Window, etc Each section has it's own directory, separated into easy, medium, and hard folders. Within these, each individual problem has it's own directory containing the answer, submission results png, and an explanation markdown file. Any problems that are not in the Top 150 will be placed in the misc directory section.
